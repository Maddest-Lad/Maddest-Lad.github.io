Games and a Look into My Personal Philosophy

---
{: data-content="Credit"}

So before I dive in, I’d like to give credit where credit is due. Much of my early philosophy which developed during my teen years was inspired by James Portnow’s video essay series: _Letters to my Nephews_.

*   [Never Giving Up](https://youtu.be/6F6xb3ucVck)
*   [Learning to Learn](https://youtu.be/4Kk_JImecgs)
*   [This Is Your Story](https://youtu.be/qGjaoVM2Hu8)

Later on, in my Senior year of high-school, I further realized my philosophy while taking twinned courses on Western and Eastern philosophy. And I would be remiss not to mention the instructors who helped me to where I am today.

*   Buddhist Thought - Leslie Cushner
*   Humanitas - Bruce Hamren, Gabe Del Real, Adam Thorman

Lastly, on my own, I’ve listened to a [compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU67W6b-tcA) of the recorded lectures of the late Alan Watts. Specifically his lessons which pertain to pulling the curtain back and looking at all the self-proclaimed serious that goes on in the world.

That’s quite the difficult question, I can only imagine how much _fun_ Overly Sarcastic Productions’ Blue had writing his blog: Philosophical Phridays.

{: data-content="So It’s All A Game?"}

I suppose I take a step back from the established social procedure, I subvert various norms on the daily, and I strive to treat everyone in the same manner whether they’re a CEO or Janitor. To put it one way, I’m what some would call an Informal Bastard or an Insubordinate.

And well I can’t blame them. When I see someone so involved in playing the game that is our society, well it just gives me the giggles. But as Watts reminds, while I may call it a game, that’s not to say it’s frivolous. It’s just that I’d rather pull back the curtain and watch with popcorn. So I guess while I might not take the big game everyone seems to play all that seriously, I will take it sincerely.

{: data-content="Other General Guidelines"}

In an effort to finish this post before the sun rises, I’ll condense my other principles into a nice bulleted list:

*   (Although cheesy) Never give up, point your mind to a task and fulfill it with your full spirit, it was worth taking on in the first place, then surely it’s completion will benefit you in the long run.
*   Don’t be malicious. There are bad situations, but you’ll damage yourself just as much (if not more) than anyone else.
*   Poke fun at people playing the game, call your club leader the “Great Sage Equal to Heaven.” While they might not appreciate it as first, I find it tends to bring back humanity that a position has stripped away.

I’ll end it on this: Don’t take life too seriously, but at least be sincere when you poke fun at it.

_I hope you had fun, I know I did_
