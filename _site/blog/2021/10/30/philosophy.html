  <p>Games and a Look into My Personal Philosophy</p>

<hr data-content="Credit" />

<p>So before I dive in, I’d like to give credit where credit is due. Much of my early philosophy which developed during my teen years was inspired by James Portnow’s video essay series: <em>Letters to my Nephews</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/6F6xb3ucVck">Never Giving Up</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/4Kk_JImecgs">Learning to Learn</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/qGjaoVM2Hu8">This Is Your Story</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Later on, in my Senior year of high-school, I further realized my philosophy while taking twinned courses on Western and Eastern philosophy. And I would be remiss not to mention the instructors who helped me to where I am today.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Buddhist Thought - Leslie Cushner</li>
  <li>Humanitas - Bruce Hamren, Gabe Del Real, Adam Thorman</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, on my own, I’ve listened to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU67W6b-tcA">compilation</a> of the recorded lectures of the late Alan Watts. Specifically his lessons which pertain to pulling the curtain back and looking at all the self-proclaimed serious that goes on in the world.</p>

<hr data-content="So, Condensing My Being Into Text" />

<p>That’s quite the difficult question, I can only imagine how much <em>fun</em> Overly Sarcastic Productions’ Blue had writing his blog: Philosophical Phridays.</p>

<p data-content="So It’s All A Game?">I suppose I take a step back from the established social procedure, I subvert various norms on the daily, and I strive to treat everyone in the same manner whether they’re a CEO or Janitor. To put it one way, I’m what some would call an Informal Bastard or an Insubordinate.</p>

<p>And well I can’t blame them. When I see someone so involved in playing the game that is our society, well it just gives me the giggles. But as Watts reminds, while I may call it a game, that’s not to say it’s frivolous. It’s just that I’d rather pull back the curtain and watch with popcorn. So I guess while I might not take the big game everyone seems to play all that seriously, I will take it sincerely.</p>

<hr data-content="Other General Guidelines" />

<p>In an effort to finish this post before the sun rises, I’ll condense my other principles into a nice bulleted list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(Although cheesy) Never give up, point your mind to a task and fulfill it with your full spirit, it was worth taking on in the first place, then surely it’s completion will benefit you in the long run.</li>
  <li>Don’t be malicious. There are bad situations, but you’ll damage yourself just as much (if not more) than anyone else.</li>
  <li>Poke fun at people playing the game, call your club leader the “Great Sage Equal to Heaven.” While they might not appreciate it as first, I find it tends to bring back humanity that a position has stripped away.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll end it on this: Don’t take life too seriously, but at least be sincere when you poke fun at it.</p>

<p><em>I hope you had fun, I know I did</em><br />
-Sam</p>
