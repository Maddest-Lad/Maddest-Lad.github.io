        <!-- Post Content -->
        <h3 class="title">Overview</h3>
        <p>Calling this week a roller coaster would be an understatement, I accepted a security engineering
            co-op at Blue Origin,
            got a new server machine, reflashed my laptop to Windows 11, and generally attempted to deal with
            the academics in the
            remaining time.</p>
        <hr/>

        <h3 class="title">Servers and Operating Systems</h3>
        <p>“Cause who needs the cloud when you can curse out your machine in person”</p>

        <p>Retrospectively, in regard to both my wallet and dwindling sanity, I should’ve just rented out a
            machine on something
            like AWS or Azure. But alas, I’d rather be the one to safeguard my own data, and I’m just going to
            guess that my
            extensive music library would probably raise a few eyebrows in the wrong places.</p>

        <p><img class="rounded-corners img_blog" src="../assets/blog_assets/server.jpg" alt="The Server"/></p>

        <p>Par for my course, when I received the server, I discovered that it only had two USB ports. Needing
            one of them
            exclusively for the boot media, the Ethernet Adapter, Keyboard, and Mouse Dongle had to compete for
            the single port. A
            thoughtful reader may wonder why an ethernet adapter is required; well, as it turns out that the
            server came with an
            RJ45 fiber optic port. So, during the installation process, I was perfectly capable of installing
            fairly basic operating
            systems such as Ubuntu Server, but I couldn’t configure the network or even begin to attempt any
            more complex operating
            systems. I realize I’ve been ranting for a while, so I’ll leave it to the reader to figure out how I
            got everything to work.</p>
        <hr/>

        <h3 class="title">Joining the Red Team at Blue, Guess I’m in Security Now</h3>
        <p>So some background, as far as I’m concerned, I’m a software engineer by trade, I’ve had two
            internships working as one, and
            it’s safe to say that I know my way around a development team. So when Blue Origin passed me up for
            a software role,
            only to have their CISO (chief information security officer) call me - suffice to say, I was
            shocked. Now that’s not to
            say I don’t enjoy messing around with software and sites - just ask RIT why their directory page
            isn’t online right now (don’t actually).</p>

        <p><img class="rounded-corners img_blog" src="../assets/blog_assets/blue.jpg" alt=""/></p>

        <p>But the pay is great, I’ve been told my mentor has a wicked sense of humor, and I’ll be given a wide
            scope to try and
            break things - what’s not to like! - Well, in my case the time it takes to become familiar with
            breaking things. Regrettably
            to me (and a relief to others’), I’m still stuck as a student working on that piece of paper we like
            to call a degree. So
            it’s out of the frying pan (the job search), and into the fire of spending my free time preparing
            myself to be the best employee I can.</p>
        <hr/>

        <h3 class="title">Alrighty</h3>
        <p>Well it’s of my opinion that this has gone on for long enough (although I am covering a whole week of
            my action-packed life),
            so let’s wrap it up here. For all our sanity’s, my next post will be a break from technology,
            delving into my equally
            convoluted personal philosophy instead. Thanks for reading my first post, I really should go write
            the preface now.</p>
