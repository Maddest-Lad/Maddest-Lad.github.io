        <h3 class="title">Credit</h3>
        <p>
            So before I dive in, I’d like to give credit where credit is due. Much of my early philosophy which
            developed during my teen years was inspired by
            James Portnow’s video essay series: <em>Letters to my Nephews</em>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/6F6xb3ucVck">Never Giving Up</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/4Kk_JImecgs">Learning to Learn</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/qGjaoVM2Hu8">This Is Your Story</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Later on, in my Senior year of high-school, I further realized my philosophy while taking twinned courses
            on Western and Eastern philosophy. And I would be remiss not to mention the instructors who helped me to
            where I am today.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Buddhist Thought - Leslie Cushner</li>
            <li>Humanitas - Bruce Hamren, Gabe Del Real, Adam Thorman</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Lastly, on my own, I’ve listened to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU67W6b-tcA">compilation</a>
            of the recorded lectures of the late Alan Watts. Specifically his lessons which pertain to pulling the
            curtain back and looking at all the self-proclaimed serious that goes on in the world.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <h3 class="title">So, Condensing My Being Into Text</h3>
        <p>
            That’s quite the difficult question, I can only imagine how much <em>fun</em> Overly Sarcastic
            Productions’ Blue had writing his blog: Philosophical Phridays.
        </p>

        <h4 class="title">So It’s All A Game?</h4>
        <p>
            I suppose I take a step back from the established social procedure, I subvert various norms on the daily,
            and I strive to treat everyone
            in the same manner whether they’re a CEO or Janitor. To put it one way, I’m what some would call an
            Informal Bastard or an Insubordinate.
        </p>

        <p>
            And well I can’t blame them. When I see someone so involved in playing the game that is our society, well
            it just gives me the giggles. But as Watts reminds, while I may call it a game, that’s not to say it’s
            frivolous. It’s just that I’d rather pull back the curtain and watch with popcorn. So I guess while I might
            not take the big game everyone seems to play all that seriously, I will take it sincerely.
        </p>

        <h4 class="title">Other General Guidelines</h4>
        <p>
            In an effort to finish this post before the sun rises, I’ll condense my other principles into a nice
            bulleted list:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>(Although cheesy) Never give up, point your mind to a task and fulfill it with your full spirit, it
                was worth taking on in the first place, then surely it’s completion will benefit you in the long
                run.
            </li>
            <li>Don’t be malicious. There are bad situations, but you’ll damage yourself just as much (if not more)
                than anyone else.
            </li>
            <li>Poke fun at people playing the game, call your club leader the “Great Sage Equal to Heaven.” While
                they might not appreciate it as first, I find it tends to bring back humanity that a position has
                stripped away.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I’ll end it on this:
            Don’t take life too seriously, but at least be sincere when you poke fun at it.</p>

        <p><em>I hope you had fun, I know I did </em><br/>
