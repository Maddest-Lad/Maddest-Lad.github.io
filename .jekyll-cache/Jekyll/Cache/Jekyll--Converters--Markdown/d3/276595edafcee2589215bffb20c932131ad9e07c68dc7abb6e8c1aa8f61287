I"°<p>I Love to Code. Whether itâ€™s automating fishing mini-games in Raft, Albion, and Minecraft, or setting your background to the top image on Reddit every morning, itâ€™s always something fun.  But Iâ€™m not afraid to get my hands dirty either, outside of programming I enjoy woodworking, cooking and all sorts of  hastily assembled prototypes like my current electric longboard and custom bass guitar I built over the summer.</p>
