&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before I dive in, I’d like to give credit where credit is due. Much of my early philosophy which developed during my teen years was inspired by
James Portnow’s video essay series: &lt;em&gt;Letters to my Nephews&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/6F6xb3ucVck&quot;&gt;Never Giving Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/4Kk_JImecgs&quot;&gt;Learning to Learn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/qGjaoVM2Hu8&quot;&gt;This Is Your Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, in my Senior year of high-school, I further realized my philosophy while taking twinned courses on Western and Eastern philosophy.
And I would be remiss not to mention the instructors who helped me to where I am today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buddhist Thought - Leslie Cushner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Humanitas - Bruce Hamren, Gabe Del Real, Adam Thorman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, on my own, I’ve listened to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU67W6b-tcA&quot;&gt;compilation&lt;/a&gt; of the recorded lectures
of the late Alan Watts. Specifically his lessons which pertain to pulling the curtain back and looking at all
the self proclaimed serious that goes on in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-condense-yourself-into-text&quot;&gt;So, Condense Yourself into Text&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s quite the difficult question, I can only imagine how much &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; Overly Sarcastic Productions’ Blue had writing his
blog: Philosophical Phridays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;so-its-all-a-game&quot;&gt;So It’s All A Game?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I take a step back from the established social procedure, I subvert various norms on the daily, and I strive to treat everyone
in the same manner whether they’re a CEO or Janitor. To put it one way, I’m what some would call an Informal Bastard or an Insubordinate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And well I can’t blame them. When I see someone so involved in playing the game that is our society, well it just gives me the giggles.
But as Watts reminds, while I may call it a game, that’s not to say it’s frivolous. It’s just that I’d rather pull back the
curtain and watch with popcorn. So I guess while I might not take the big game everyone seems to play all that seriously, 
I will take it sincerely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-general-guidelines&quot;&gt;Other General Guidelines&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to finish this post before the sun rises, I’ll condense my other principles into a nice bulleted list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(Although cheesy) Never give up, point your mind to a task and fulfill it with your full spirit, it was worth taking on in the first place, then surely it’s completion will benefit you in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t be malicious. There are bad situations, but you’ll damage yourself just as much (if not more) than anyone else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Poke fun at people playing the game, call your club leader the “Great Sage Equal to Heaven.” While they might not appreciate it as first, I find it tends to bring back humanity that a position has stripped away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to fall asleep at an at least moderately unreasonable time (we’re talking like 4:00am), I’ll end it on this: 
Don’t take life too seriously, but at least be sincere in your casual mockery of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I shall make like a tree and leave &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling this week a roller coaster would be an understatement, I accepted a security engineering co-op at Blue Origin, 
got a new server machine, reflashed my laptop to Windows 11, and generally attempted to deal with the academics in the
remaining time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;servers-and-operating-systems&quot;&gt;Servers and Operating Systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cause who needs the cloud when you can curse out your machine in person”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retrospectively, in regard to both my wallet and dwindling sanity, I should’ve just rented out a machine on something 
like AWS or Azure. But alas, I’d rather be the one to safeguard my own data, and I’m just going to guess that my 
extensive music library would probably raise a few eyebrows in the wrong places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/901591681026113578/901591741868695612/server.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Server&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Par for my course, when I received the server, I discovered that it only had two USB ports. Needing one of them 
exclusively for the boot media, the Ethernet Adapter, Keyboard, and Mouse Dongle had to compete for the single port. A
thoughtful reader may wonder why an ethernet adapter is required; well, as it turns out that the server came with an 
RJ45 fiber optic port. So, during the installation process, I was perfectly capable of installing fairly basic operating 
systems such as Ubuntu Server, but I couldn’t configure the network or even begin to attempt any more complex operating
systems. I realize I’ve been ranting for a while, so I’ll leave it to the reader to figure out how I got everything to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;joining-the-red-team-at-blue-guess-im-in-security-now&quot;&gt;Joining the Red Team at Blue, Guess I’m in Security Now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So some background, as far as I’m concerned, I’m a software engineer by trade, I’ve had two internships working as one, and
it’s safe to say that I know my way around a development team. So when Blue Origin passed me up for a software role, 
only to have their CISO (chief information security officer) call me - suffice to say, I was shocked. Now that’s not to
say I don’t enjoy messing around with software and sites - just ask RIT why their directory page isn’t online right now  (don’t actually).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t9uTBm6jxhxCbTiMZWgjBe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the pay is great, I’ve been told my mentor has a wicked sense of humor, and I’ll be given a wide scope to try and 
break things - what’s not to like! - Well, in my case the time it takes to become familiar with breaking things. Regrettably
to me (and a relief to others’), I’m still stuck as a student working on that piece of paper we like to call a degree. So 
it’s out of the frying pan (the job search), and into the fire of spending my free time preparing myself to be the best employee I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alrighty&quot;&gt;Alrighty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well it’s of my opinion that this has gone on for long enough (although I am covering a whole week of my action-packed life),
so let’s wrap it up here. For all our sanity’s, my next post will be a break from technology, delving into my equally
convoluted personal philosophy instead. Thanks for reading my first post, I really should go write the preface now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Then There Was One &lt;br /&gt;
